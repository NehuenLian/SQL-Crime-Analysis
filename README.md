I have decided to carry out a data analysis project focused on crime in the city of Chicago, between the years 2008 and 2009. This analysis reveals details about arrests, trends, most predominant crimes, and the areas that were more prone to experiencing such events.

In 2008 and 2009, there were 547 crimes registered in the city of Chicago.
Additionally, out of those 547 crimes, homicide is the most frequent, with 336 cases.

Specific analysis for 2008 and 2009 separately:

IN 2008

There were 224 crimes.
Out of those 224 crimes, there have been 54 arrests, and 170 crimes have remained unsolved.
The most dangerous area was area 67 (West Englewood) with 8 homicides.
Out of the 54 arrests made, 45 have been for murder.
Out of the 170 unsolved crimes, 60 of them are for murder, and 56 for robbery.
There have been no narcotics-related crimes registered.
IN 2009

There were 323 crimes.
Out of those 323 crimes, there have been 125 arrests, and 198 have remained unsolved.
The most dangerous area was area 25 (Austin) with 25 homicides.
Out of the 125 arrests made, 107 have been for homicide.
Out of the 198 unsolved crimes, 124 of them are for homicide, 41 for robbery, and 27 for assault or battery.
Conclusion

There are fewer arrests made compared to unsolved crimes.
We can also see that in 2009, there were more arrests than in 2008, but also more crimes unsolved, a year in which there were 100 more cases than the previous one. Something that is obvious since, statistically speaking, all parameters rise in the same proportion if the numbers increase (without taking into account external collateral factors).

The fact that area 25 (Austin) is the one with the highest number of registered crimes coincides with the fact that it was the most populated area of Chicago according to the census published on the city's official website (+110k people in the 2000s). Today, according to the 2020 census, it ranks third.

Homicide is the most frequent crime and the one with the most arrests, and this is due to it being the most common, but also to other factors:

It is more difficult to cover up as it is more conspicuous.
It is more serious, so law enforcement agencies allocate more resources to address it.
Homicides can have a significant impact on the community and generate the collaboration of people willing to assist in the investigation.
On the other hand, robbery has had very few arrests relative to the cases that have occurred (57 robberies and only 1 arrest in 2008 and 43 robberies in 2009 and only 2 arrests).

For this work, I have used MySQL (MySQL Workbench), Python, Excel, and Matplotlib both to extract the data and to create the graphs that I will provide below for a better understanding of the analysis.

Note: In the second and third graphs, "True" is understood as successful arrests and "False" is understood as unsuccessful arrests.
